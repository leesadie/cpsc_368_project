# CPSC 368 Project

- my sql script is working but doesn't have small gdhi table included yet, that can be added manually 
- the foreign and primary keys from the other script does not work for some of the tables because PK needs to be unique indentifer, so it cannot be PRIMARY KEY (region_num, org_code) for workforce. 
-  I left PK out of mine, but we can add them back properly after chatting tomorrow
-  my eda only is looking at the main table but goes into much more depth so maybe we can use mine plus eda from other tables
-  todo add more description into EDA
